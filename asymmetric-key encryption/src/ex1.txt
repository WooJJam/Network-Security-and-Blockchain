Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security
In a public-key encryption system, anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext, but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.

For example, a journalist can publish the public key of an encryption key pair on a web site so that sources can send secret messages to the news organization in ciphertext. Only the journalist who knows the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertexts to obtain the sources' messages an eavesdropper reading email on its way to the journalist cannot decrypt the ciphertexts.

key encryption does not conceal metadata like what computer a source used to send a message, when they sent it, or how long it is. Public key encryption on its own also does not tell the recipient anything about who sent a message it just conceals the content of a message in a ciphertext that can only be decrypted with the private key.
